      <p className="text-mine-silver mb-3">$MINE is not just another mining token—it's a <strong>real-world compute asset</strong> designed to provide value through multiple utilities:</p>
      <ul className="text-mine-silver space-y-2 list-disc pl-5">
        <li><strong>Mining Power & Security</strong> – $MINE is mined through <strong>KawPow PoW</strong>, ensuring decentralized security with GPU-optimized mining.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Compute Leasing</strong> – Token holders can stake $MINE to access <strong>GPU leasing for AI training, inference, and compute-intensive workloads</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Deflationary Burn Model</strong> – AI-generated revenue is used for <strong>constant buybacks & burns</strong>, reducing supply and increasing token value over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Compute Marketplace</strong> – Users can lease and rent GPU power via smart contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Economic Model</strong> – <strong>60% of block rewards go to miners, while 40% funds hardware expansion & AI revenue burns.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mining & Yield Farming</strong> – Miners earn $MINE and can reinvest in high-performance compute nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Chain Flexibility</strong> – $MINE will integrate into <strong>multiple PoW ecosystems and AI compute platforms</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
